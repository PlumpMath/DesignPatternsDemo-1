# DesignPatternsDemo
1. The Observer pattern: <br/>
-- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated <br/>
-- Simple implementation with push and pull capabilities

2. Adapter pattern:<br/>
-- Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise, because of incompatible interfaces

3. Strategy pattern:<br/>
-- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
