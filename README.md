# DesignPatternsDemo
1. The Observer pattern 
- Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated
- Simple implementation with push and pull capabilities

2. Adapter pattern:
- Lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise, because of incompatible interfaces

3. Strategy pattern:
- Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
